= flutterdemos

A demo app that runs a bunch of self-contained Flutter demos.
Most are winnowed down to their minimum for
easier understanding than some of the official
demos which IMHO have a bit of rhetorical flourish that at least takes longer to read.

== TODO

Add a button to display the source code.

== Maint

If you change `images/logo.png`, be sure to run

	flutter pub run flutter_launcher_icons

This generates the derivative icon files for all platforms listed in the
icons section of pubspec.yaml.
